Hello! I am a software engineer conducting research at [HEC Liège Management School](https://hec.uliege.be). My fields of interests are intelligent systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, optimization and robotics. I am fluent in Python but can also speak C, C++, Java, PHP and some more exotic languages such as Scheme and Haskell.

My goal is to make the world a better place with the help of automation and AI.

# Background
I grew up in Belgium, the land of beer, chocolate and fries.

In 2018, I graduated from the University of Liège with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My curriculum had a strong focus on machine learning, optimization and artificial intelligence.

I then took on a researcher and teaching assistant position at HEC Liège Management School where I taught courses at the Bachelor's and Master's level. I helped developing virtual and augmented reality projects within the [SIG](http://www.sig.hec.uliege.be/). I also conducted research on flight delay predictions and the three-dimensional bin packing problem.

## Notable Achivements
Winner of the [WeCargo hackathon in 2019](https://www.wecargo.be/) with a proposal for a Ground Service Equipment pooling and usage prediction tool written in PHP.
