Hello! I am a software engineer conducting research at [HEC Li√®ge Management School](https://hec.uliege.be). My fields of interests are intelligent systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, optimization and robotics. I am fluent in Python but can also speak C, C++, Java, PHP and some more exotic languages such as Scheme and Haskell.

My goal is to make the world a better place with the help of automation and AI.

# Notable Achivements
Winner of the [WeCargo hackathon in 2019](https://www.wecargo.be/) with a proposal for a Ground Service Equipment pooling and usage prediction tool written in PHP.
