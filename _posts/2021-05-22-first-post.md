An inaugural post to kick off this personal blog and portfolio! I will be using this website as a freeform tool for 'thinking out loud'. It will be both a developer diary and a showcase of ongoing and past projects. Feel free to contribute if anything catches your eye: the entire website's [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/flopeters1337/flopeters1337.github.io).

I might post some other updates about electronics and potentially D&D related stuff so stay tuned!
